# JSONPOWERDB-PROJECT-Employees-Details
Simple JPDB project to get employees details.

"This project is all about basics of JsonPowerDB (JPDB) and how to use JPDB for CRUD operations."

About JsonPowerDB:
JsonPowerDB is a Real-time, High Performance, Lightweight and Simple to Use, Rest API based Multi-mode DBMS. JsonPowerDB has ready to use API for 
Json document DB, RDBMS, Key-value DB, GeoSpatial DB and Time Series DB functionality. JPDB supports and advocates for true serverless and pluggable 
API development

Here I have created a simple JPDB project to collect some basic details employees. Hera I have used the library provided in the tutorials(cource) is used to make
the code shorter and readable.

Benefits of using JsonPowerDB:
Simplest way to retrieve data in a JSON format.
Schema-free, Simple to use, Nimble and In-Memory database.
It is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engine - PowerIndeX.
It is low level (raw) form of data and is also human readable.
It helps developers in faster coding, in-turn reduces development cost
