<pre class="rate">

    So , We rate the Trip Based on Kilometers travelled :
    Rates are Divided into Two Parts :

    If one travels less than 100 Kilometers
        His Rate Would be Calculated as tripdist X 4
    OtherWise
        Rate = tripdist X 5

    

            
</pre>
<h1>How is Trip Distance Calculated ?</h1>
<pre class="rate">

    So , At the start of Every Trip Total Distance
    Travelled by the Booked is Noted Down.

    Then ,
        When A customer has to Return the Car
        At that time he/she has to enter the
        Current Total Distance Travelled By Car

    Now,
        Simple Maths : Final - Initial (Distance)
        and Voil√† we have the Trip Distance
